The arguments consist of many parameters needed to install the driver, such as the URL to retrieve it from, the location of the INF file in the archive (where necessary), any special instructions needed to compile the driver (where necessary), etc.When an unknown device ID is entered into the database, Wifix providesan invitation to the customer to provide the IDs to the Wifix project. These IDs are then added to the database, along with the appropriate mappings, when the appropriate driver is found. co tam ?
